# Qiskit Camp Africa 2019

## Things to do before the hackathon

Check the [Preparation & installation document](preparation%26installation.md) note for things to do before the hackathon.

## I have an idea for the hackathon

Open an issue in this repo (using the [`new project`](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-africa-19/issues/new?assignees=&labels=members+wanted&template=new-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template) and explain your idea in some paragraphs.

## Time for pitching the idea

Before the hackathon starts, all the ideas that are register in this repo will be very shortly explained by the original submitter in a short pitch format. You have 3 minutes for this pitch. Make sure that you mention, at least, these three elements: team number, the problem to solve, the kind of people you need in your team.

## I would like to participate in an existing idea

Participants and coaches can comment and add information as comments in the ideas (as issue comments). [After the pitches](#time-for-pitching-the-idea), there is time for team formation. Find the person behind the idea (feel free to slack them) and ask for more. Once you are convinced, add a comment in the issue mentioning `@qcamp` (our [helpful bot](https://github.com/qcamp)). After some seconds, you will be assigned to the issue. Being assigned to the issue means being part of the team.

## I am already in a team, but I want to change

If a participant that was assigned to team changes their mind it can be reassigned to a different team. For that the participant has to unassigned theirselves from the current team and post a comment mentioning `@qcamp` in the new team. A participant cannot be assigned to more than one open team at any time.

## None of the existing ideas is suitable for me :(

If any idea is suitable for you, considering submitting your own idea. Maybe, you feel that the full thing is over your head, considering joining the [Good First Issues team](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-africa-19/issues/1). You want be participating of the competition, but you will contribute and learn a lot!

## My team is not reaching the minimum amount of members

If during the team formation stage your team is not gaining tractionTeams with two or less members are candidates to be closed. It will be [labeled as such](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-africa-19/labels/candidate%20to%20be%20closed) and it some sort of last call to encourage its members to find more participants interested in the idea. After some undefined amount of time, it will be closed and its members are free to find new teams. 

## My team is complete

Once a team reaches 5 members, the issue is labeled as `group is full`. Since 5 is a hard limit, the team cannot have more members. If you see that there is more people interested, consider opening a new team as a spin off and forward the participants to this new issue.

## My team is ready. Let's hack!

After the project is defined and the team is complete, you can ask an IBMer in the channel `#qiskit-camp-africa` (qiskit.slack.com) to add the label `group ready`. This should happen before the group formation stage is finished. From this point on, you can use the issue to communicate progress as additional comments.

## The team needs a coach

A Qiskit coach guides and advices the team in its project.
Also will be your contact point after the hackathon, in case that the project have a continuation.
The team needs a coach before the final submission at the end of the hackathon.

## It's presentation time!
