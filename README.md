# Qiskit Camp Africa 2019

## Things to do before the hackathon

Check the [`preparation&installation`](preparation%26installation.md) note for things to do before the hackathon

## I have an idea for the hackathon

Open an issue using the [`new project template`](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-africa-19/issues/new?assignees=&labels=members+wanted&template=new-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template.

## I would like to participate in an existing idea

## My team is complete

Once a team reaches 5 members, the issue is labeled as `group is full`.

## The project is ready. Let's hack!

After the project is defined and the team is complete, you can ask an IBMer in the channel `#qiskit-camp-africa` (qiskit.slack.com) to add the label `group ready`. This should happen before the group formation stage is finished. From this point on, you can use the issue to communicate progress as additional comments.

## The team needs a coach

A Qiskit coach guides and advices the team in its project.
Also will be your contact point after the hackathon, in case that the project have a continuation.
The team needs a coach before the final submission at the end of the hackathon.

## It's presentation time!
